# CrossfitYouTubeChannel


 This app includes few crossfit channels on Youtube, basically, with crossfit movements video tutorials. And allows easily overview content of theses channels and helps to increase a crossfit motivation. 

In this app, I used the following stack of technologies: YouTube Data API, AdMob API, Volley third-party libraries, JSON, Snackbar, RecyclerView, AsyncTask, Threads, Concurrency, Intent, SharedPreferences, File.
